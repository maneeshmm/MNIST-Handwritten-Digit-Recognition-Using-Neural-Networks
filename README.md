# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Neural Networks

## 1. Introduction

The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark in computer vision and consists of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal of this project is to build a Neural Network (NN) model that can accurately classify these digits. Neural networks, especially deep learning models, have been widely used for digit recognition tasks due to their ability to learn complex patterns.

## 2. Data Preprocessing

The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels.

Steps in Preprocessing:

Loading Data: The dataset is loaded from tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist.

Normalization: Pixel values (0-255) are scaled to the range [0,1] by dividing by 255 to improve model convergence.

Reshaping Data: If needed, the images are reshaped to match the input format required by the model.

One-Hot Encoding: The labels (0-9) are converted into one-hot vectors for better training performance in categorical classification.

## 3. Neural Network Architecture

The model is implemented using Keras Sequential API and consists of the following layers:

Model Structure:

Input Layer: Takes in the 28x28 pixel image as a flattened 784-dimensional vector.

Hidden Layers:

Dense (fully connected) layers with ReLU activation to learn patterns.

Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

Output Layer: A Dense layer with softmax activation to predict probabilities for 10 digit classes.

## 4. Model Training & Optimization

Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy (since itâ€™s a multi-class classification problem).

Optimizer: Adam (adaptive learning rate for efficient training).

Batch Size: Training is done in mini-batches to optimize gradient updates.

Epochs: The model is trained for multiple epochs to achieve better accuracy.

Validation: A portion of the training set is used for validation to monitor performance.

## 5. Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated using the test dataset. The key metrics used include:

Accuracy: Measures overall correctness.

Confusion Matrix: Shows misclassified digits.

Loss & Accuracy Curves: Visualized using Matplotlib to track training progress.

## 6. Results & Observations

The model achieves high accuracy (>95%) on test data.

Misclassification occurs mostly in similar-looking digits (e.g., 3 vs. 8, 4 vs. 9).

Using additional techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) could further improve performance.

## 7. Conclusion

This project successfully implemented a fully connected neural network for MNIST digit recognition. The model demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency, showing the potential of deep learning in image classification tasks. Future improvements could include CNNs and hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
